/**
 * Rewrite the tests badge in all ten READMEs to the real numbers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The badge is `tests-<count>%20%C2%B7%20<files>%20files`, and `docs-numbers
 * .test.ts` asserts it equals the true counts. So every commit that adds a test
 * file makes ten READMEs fail, and the fix is a mechanical string replacement
 * performed by hand — which is how a repo ends up with ten near-identical
 * "docs(readme): badge" commits per round and still gets the number wrong when
 * someone forgets.
 *
 * The count here is *derived*, not passed in, and it is derived by **running
 * the suite** — not by counting `it(` in the source. A static count is wrong
 * for this repo: `it.each(TABLE)(...)` is one `it(` in the file and eleven
 * tests at runtime, and there are four such call sites. Counting source lines
 * reported 587 when the suite runs 675.
 *
 * `vitest run --reporter=json` is the only honest source. It costs a suite
 * run (~14 s), which is fine for the once-per-round job this is meant for,
 * and `--verify` is the mode that runs in CI where that cost is already paid.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/sync-test-badge.mjs            # rewrite
 *   node scripts/sync-test-badge.mjs --verify   # report only, exit 1 if stale
