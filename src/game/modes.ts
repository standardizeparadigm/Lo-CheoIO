/**
 * Game modes & balance math — public surface.
 *
 * v1.1.7: this 255-line file became a folder plus two siblings:
 *
 *   modeTypes.ts      ModeId · ModeConfig          (types only)
 *   modes/<id>.ts     one balance record per mode  (nine files)
 *   modesIndex.ts     MODES · MODE_LIST · isModeId (assembles them)
 *   modeMath.ts       multiplierForCombo · levelForCatches · jarBonus ·
 *                     comboWindowFor · jarBonusFor · COMBO_WINDOW · MAX_CRACKS
 *
 * Every name below is re-exported here, so `import { … } from "game/modes"`
 * keeps working — the engine and the tests were not touched.
