   Lọ Chéo — pure gain math for the WebAudio engine (v1.1.6)

   Keeping these calculations pure makes them testable without an
   AudioContext, and pins down one real bug found during the v1.1.6 audit:
   `unlock()` used to wire the music bus at a flat 0.5, ignoring the
   player's `musicVolume` until some later setter happened to run — so the
   first run after a reload always played music louder than configured.

/**
 * Final SFX peak for one sound: base gain × SFX volume (0..1).
 *
 * ROUND 6: the base gain is clamped to 0..1, not merely floored at zero.
 *
 * `Math.max(0, Infinity)` is Infinity, so `sfxPeak(Infinity, 1)` returned
 * Infinity and went straight into `GainNode.gain.value`. WebAudio does not
 * reject that — it clips to full scale and, on some implementations, latches
 * the node into a state that later ramps cannot recover, which presents as
 * "the sound effects stopped working after one loud frame" and is not
 * reproducible without the exact value.
 *
 * Clamping at 1 is also the correct *audio* answer: a peak above unity is
 * digital clipping by definition, so there is nothing to preserve above it.
 * `volume` was already going through `unit()`, which clamps — the base gain
 * simply never got the same treatment.
