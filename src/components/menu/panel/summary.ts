/**
 * The INFO panel's filler: a compact read-out of what the build contains.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE
 * --------------
 * INFO holds four rows. Its panel is sized for seven, because GAME needs seven
 * and the two panels share a height so the corner row reads as one band. That
 * leaves ~126px of empty panel — plainly visible in the round-5 screenshot as a
 * blank rectangle under «THOÁT».
 *
 * Round 2 filled a similar gap in the *hero* with three counters (9 · 14 · 16)
 * and the report rejected it, twice: once because it repeated the tagline, and
 * once because it was in the wrong place entirely. The lesson was not "never
 * show counts" — it was "do not show them where they duplicate something the
 * player just read".
 *
 * This is a different address. The counts are not in the hero any more (the
 * tagline that stated them moved into the about modal), and this is a *panel*,
 * whose job is exactly to summarise. Three rows, one line each, derived from
 * the same catalogue the rest of the app reads, so they cannot disagree with
 * the modes list or the achievements list.

 *
