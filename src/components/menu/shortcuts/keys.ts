/**
 * The keyboard and pointer bindings, as data.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DATA
 * ----------------
 * The bindings were only ever written down in two places: the `switch` in
 * `GameCanvas.tsx` and a four-key row inside the how-to modal. Neither is
 * discoverable from the menu, and neither is a complete list — `Space` (slam)
 * and `Escape` (pause) were documented nowhere at all.
 *
 * This module is the single list. `GameCanvas` still owns the *handling*; what
 * it does not own is the answer to "what can I press?", which is a question the
 * menu should be able to answer without opening the game.
 *
 * `tests/shortcuts.test.ts` asserts that every binding listed here that names a
 * `key`, actually appears in the game's key handler — so the panel cannot
 * advertise a key that does nothing (the round-1 «hoặc nhấn ENTER» bug).
 */

/** How a binding is presented in the panel. */
export type BindingKind = "key" | "pointer";

/** One row of the shortcut list. */
export interface KeyBinding {
  /** The keys as printed, one cap per entry. */
  caps: readonly string[];
  /** i18n key for what it does. */
  action: string;
  /** Keyboard, or a pointer gesture. */
  kind: BindingKind;
}

/**
 * The bindings the game actually listens for.
 *
 * Order is by how often a new player needs them: steer, strike, mute, pause.
 * A list sorted alphabetically would put `Escape` first, which is the one thing
 * nobody opens the panel to find.
 *
 * THERE IS NO BOOST KEY. A first draft listed `SHIFT` for it because "boost"
 * is a real mechanic (speed builds as you weave) and it *felt* like there should
 * be a key for it. There is not: `grep -n shiftKey src/components/GameCanvas.tsx`
 * returns nothing. That is exactly the class of mistake the removed «hoặc nhấn
 * ENTER» hint made in round 1 — advertising a control that was never wired up —
 * and it is why `tests/shortcuts.test.ts` checks every cap against the game's
 * own key handler instead of trusting this comment.
