 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * v1.1.7 sized the menu with padding and hope. The corner panels sized
 * themselves from their contents, the ticker sized itself from its text, and
 * the hero got whatever height was left over. Nothing declared a height, so
 * nothing could be checked, and the two failures in the report followed:
 *
 *   - the hero was pushed *out of the top* of the window, cutting the `LỌ`
 *     glyph in half
 *   - the corner panels overflowed the bottom, cutting `CÀI ĐẶT` and the
 *     copyright row
 *
 * v1.1.8 declares the heights instead. Every value here is consumed by
 * `planMenuLayout()` and pinned by `tests/menu-layout.test.ts`, so a future
 * change that re-introduces the overflow fails a test before it reaches a
 * screenshot.
 *
 * Units are CSS pixels at 1× — no vh, no %, nothing that depends on how long
 * a translation happens to be. That is the whole point: six rows must be
 * 268px in Vietnamese and 268px in Thai.

 * difference between "crop the wordmark" and "show it". The labels stay
 * legible: 26px is one 11px line with 7px of padding, which is still a
 * comfortable tap target once the row is full-width — and in landscape it is.
