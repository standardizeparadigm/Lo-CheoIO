/**
 * Read the viewport and keep a `MenuPlan` in sync with it.
 *
 * The plan itself is pure (`fit.ts`); this hook only supplies the width and
 * height. Keeping the subscription here rather than in StartScreen means the
 * layout decision stays testable and the component stays a renderer.
 *
 * Notes on the implementation:
 *
 *   - `visualViewport` is preferred when available. On mobile browsers
 *     `window.innerHeight` includes the URL bar that slides away, so a plan
 *     computed from it changes as the user scrolls — which is one of the ways
 *     a layout appears to "jump" on its own.
 *   - Updates are coalesced into an animation frame. A resize drag fires
 *     dozens of events per second and re-planning on each one is wasted work.
 *   - The initial value is computed synchronously from `window` on the client
 *     so the first paint is already correct (no flash from a default plan).
 *     On the server there is no `window`, so it falls back to the 1280×720
 *     reference plan — which is what the SSR smoke test renders.

 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS HAS TO GET RIGHT
 * --------------------------------
 * 1. `visualViewport` reports `0` for both dimensions while a page is being
 *    restored from the back/forward cache, and momentarily during a rotation.
 *    `??` does not catch that — it only catches `null`/`undefined` — so a 0
 *    flowed through as a real measurement and produced a plan for a 1×1
 *    viewport, which is a blank screen for one frame.
 *
 * 2. `Math.round(NaN)` is `NaN`. The plan's own `sane()` clamp now handles
 *    that, but returning NaN from a function whose contract is "a viewport"
 *    pushes the check to every caller. Falling back here keeps the contract.
 *
 * The fallback is the reference viewport rather than a "best guess": when the
 * browser cannot say how big the window is, the honest answer is the size this
 * layout was designed against, not a number invented from a broken one.
